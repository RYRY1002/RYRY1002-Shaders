# License

### Informal
Do not redistribute the RYRY1002 Shaders, or a derivative of the RYRY1002 Shaders, without our explicit permission.

We will probably allow you to release an RYRY1002 Shader edit if it contains substantial contributions. Continuum to SEUS is a good example of "substantial contributions" to a shaderpack.

I better not see RYRY1002 Shaders re-hosted on a site like 9minecraft.net.
For website owners like 9minecraft.net, *DO NOT RE-UPLOAD THIS SHADER TO YOUR WEBSITE WITHOUT OUR EXPLICIT PERMISSION!*
